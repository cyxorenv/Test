# In python there is three types of numbers:
# =----------------------------------------=
# 1) x = 1   int (Integer)
# 2) y = 1.1 float (a decimal point)
# 3) z = 1 + 2j  (Complex numbers)

# Standart arithmetic in python - (and any outher programming languige).

# Addition
print(10 + 3)
# Sustruction
print(10 - 3)
# Multiplication
print(10 * 3)
# Division
print(10 / 3)  # Here you get a float resaults
# 2nd Devision
print(10 // 3)  # Here you get a int resaults.
# Mudulus
print(10 % 3)  # The remainder of Devision.
# Exponent
print(10 ** 3)  # 10 * 10 * 10 = 1000

# Augmented assignment operator.
# you can use all operation above.
x = 10
x += 3  # Same as (x = x + 3)
print(x)
